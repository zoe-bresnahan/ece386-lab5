# Structured Outputs

***Student:** Complete below.*

## How well did it work?

It works very well but all it takes as inputs are age and name of the user. It sometimes adds things that you don't tell it to add. It makes guesses as to what you would want. For example, it made Dr.Baek's favorite toy a telescope without prompted.

## Paste a few input/output combos
input1: python3 user_creation.py "make a user named John Smith that is 30 years old "

output1:

                name='John Smith' age=30 color='Blue' favorite_toy='Action Figures'

input2: python3 user_creation.py "make a user named Dr.Baek that is 100 years old"

output2:
                name='Dr.Baek' age=100 color='White' favorite_toy='A telescope'

input3: ai@ubuntu:~/ece386-lab5/structured_outputs$ python3 user_creation.py "make a user named Hana who is 22 years old and whose favorite activity is playing piano"

output3:
name='Hana' age=22 color='Favorite color' favorite_toy='Piano' favorite_activity='Playing piano'
